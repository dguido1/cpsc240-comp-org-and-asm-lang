//Author information

//
//Program information
//  Program name: Discover Op Codes
//  Programming languages: One module in C++, and one in X86, and one in Bash script.
//  Date program began: 2017-Dec-01
//  Date of last update: 2018-Apr-30
//  Files in this program: opcode.cpp, discovery.asm, r.sh
//
//Purpose
//  The intent of this program is to provide a platform where users can reverse engineer instructions at the binary level.  Look at
//  the .lis file and make educated guesses as to what the opcode is for any operation.  Students of assembly programming should
//  experiment with changing an opcode in the executable file.
//
//This file:
//  FIle name: opcode.cpp
//  Language: C++
//  Max page width: 132 columns
//  Status: This program was tested more than 7 times on Debian9.3.0 (Dec 2017) without issues.
//  Compile: g++ -c -m64 -Wall -fno-pie -no-pie -l opcode.lis -o opcode.o opcode.cpp
//  Optimal print specification: Portrait, 7 points, monospace, 8Â½x11 paper










//Are all these includes really needed?  Can't we omit a few?  What happened to namespace?
