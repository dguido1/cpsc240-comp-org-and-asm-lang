 //There is one physical clock in the computer, which outputs tics at a given frequency often measured in units GHz.  However, there
 //are multiple ways to view and interface with that physical clock.  These management styles are known as 
 // CLOCK_REALTIME

 // CLOCK_MONOTONIC

 //frequency is 500 MHz, then the resolution is 1sec/5000000000tics = 2 ns/tic, and we say the resolution is 2 ns (2 nanoseconds).
 //Current day software does not support a time unit smaller than 1 ns, therefore, if a clock has a true resolution something less
