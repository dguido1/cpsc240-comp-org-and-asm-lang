## Actual Output:

```
Welcome to Electric Circuit Processing (ECP) by David Guido.

This program will compute the resistance of a circuit configured with parallel sub-circuits.

Enter the resistance of a circuit: 3.2
Enter the resistance of a circuit: 1.2
Enter the resistance of a circuit: 43.1
Enter the resistance of a circuit: 

Thank you. The number of sub-circuits is 3

The total resistance in this system is R = 0.855406 OHM's.

Thank you for using ECP.  The total resistance will now be returned to the driver program.

The driver received this number: 0.855406243539383770.
The driver will now return 0 to the operating system. Have a nice day.
